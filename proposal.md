# Community Software Analysis Proposal
Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: *PyClaw*

*PyClaw is a Python-based solver for hyperbolic PDEs. Solvers written in Fortran code is also available, but this project will solve problems in Python without explicitly using any Fortran code. A Riemann solver that can solve advection, Burger's equation, Euler equations, shallow water equations, and etc., is available with examples and source code.*
